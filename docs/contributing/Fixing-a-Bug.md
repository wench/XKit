An extension broke and it's time to fix it. Here's how!

## Basic Fixes

1. Open up the [XKit Editor](https://tumblr.com/xkit_editor)
2. Click on "Open Extension" and select the extension you want to change
3. Click "Save Extension" after making changes
4. Refresh any open Tumblr page to see if your changes worked
5. Once your changes are complete, open up your fork of New XKit and find the extension's file in the Extensions directory.
6. Edit this file using GitHub's editor, duplicating whatever changes you made in XKit's editor.
7. Commit the changes and submit a pull request. Our documentation on pull requests is [here](./Pull-Requests.md). For more general information, check out
[GitHub's documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

[This](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit/pull/18) is a particularly great example of a pull request.
