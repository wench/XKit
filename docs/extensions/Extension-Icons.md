# Extension Icon

Good branding is important for good extensions. As such, your extension icon is very important.  A poorly designed icon, or an icon that doesn't fit with the rest of XKit's iconography, will make your extension seem amateurish and poorly developed.

**Keep your icon simple.** Focus your icon around a single symbol directly related to what your extension does. Try not to use more than one symbol per icon.

**Avoid ambiguity.** Though your icon should be simple, make sure it's not vague. An abstract icon makes it hard to understand what your extension does.

**Avoid realism.** Keep your icon as simple as possible by using a symbol rather than realistic images.

**Keep your backgrounds clear.** Other than your central symbol, there shouldn't be much in the background to distract from it.

**Mind your colors.** Use light background colors and avoid dark ones. Contrast the colors between your symbol and the background so that it doesn't blend in.

### Technical Details

* XKit extension icons are 64x64 pixels.
* The symbols should be at least 4 px away from the edge of the icon.
* Keep your icon squareâ€”XKit will automatically round the corners for you.
* Not sure what symbol to use? [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/) is a good resource to check out for reference.
* Still having trouble with your icon? Check out Google's [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/style/icons.html#icons-product-icons) for additional help. (If you're _really_ desperate, [Apple's icon guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/graphics/app-icon/) are a good resource, too.)
